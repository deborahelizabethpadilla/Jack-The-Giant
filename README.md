This application was created as a replication of the iOS game, Jack The Giant. This project firmed up my knowledge on creating a SpriteKit application that allows users to play the game, Jack The Giant.

**The application offers the following features:**

* Creating a replicated game of Jack The Giant.
* Saving high score.
* Features illusions of climbing movement.
* Different scenes.
* Various physics movements.

**Technologies Used In Application:**
* SpriteKit
* Game Scenes
* SKSpriteNodes
* SKActions
* Swift
* Image Assests
* Physics Body
* Camera


**Testing The App:**
* Download the project to your computer from this project page.
* Once the project is downloaded, open the .xcodeproj file from the folder.
* Run the project either using the iPhone simulator or your device. I recommend running the project on the latest iPhone device. It should be compiled with the latest version of Xcode.
* If you choose to download it on your device, please plug in your device to your computer and make the device target your device model. Then click 'run'.

**Closing:**

In conclusion, I have learned a lot by working on this project. I am confident that I mastered SpriteKit and am able to successfully create applications using different scenes, functions and assets in order to create an exciting game.
